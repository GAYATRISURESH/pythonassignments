Bloom Filter
	Data Structure for representing a set
	Exetremely space efficient 
 	Probabilistic data structure 
		AddKey: Adds a key in to the set 
		IsMember: Check if keys is in set with False Positivies 
		DeleteKey: Not supported 

Bloom filter is represented by m slots, k hash functions and n elements:
	A empty bloom filter is a bit array of m bits
	We need k number of hash functions to calculate the hashes for a given input.
	The input element (n) 
Uses hash values to generate indices and assign those with '1'. 
During a search operation same hash is used to calculate the hash value and if any of the resultant index returns a zero value then it returns a negative result.
If all of the index returns value '1' then it probably means that the data is present (or not)(false positive).
